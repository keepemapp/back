https://github.com/chrislusf/seaweedfs[SeaweedFS] is the chosen distributed file system
to keep our user's most precious files safe.
It has several features requiring us to have different seaweed services running:

* Master
* Server
* Filer
* S3 API (optional)

== Dev Setup
https://github.com/chrislusf/seaweedfs/releases[Download] the correct installation four your OS.
In most intel/AMD processors, it's `linux_amd64`

[source,bash]
----
mkdir $HOME/seaweed_data
# Starts master, 1 server and filer
weed server -dir=$HOME/seaweed_data -filer=true -filer.encryptVolumeData
----

[source,bash]
.Example usage
----
# Upload a file inside webs folder (end / REQUIRED!)
curl -I -F file=@bookmarks.html "http://localhost:8888/webs/"
# Returns {"name":"bookmarks.html","size":38838}

# Lists files under directory
# https://github.com/chrislusf/seaweedfs/wiki/Filer-Server-API#list-files-under-a-directory
curl -H "Accept: application/json" \
"http://localhost:8888/webs/?pretty=y"


# Get response headers
curl -I "http://localhost:8888/webs/bookmarks.html"
# Get file
curl "http://localhost:8888/webs/bookmarks.html"

curl -i -X DELETE "http://localhost:8888/webs/bookmarks.html"

== Useful commands


=== Volumes

sometimes one of your volume server may go down, and a new volume server is added. Here is the command you can run to fix volumes that are under replicated:

WARNING: This Locks the cluster for write and read (??) and it costs some time. Use with caution

[source,bash]
----
# check any volume that are under replicated, and there are servers that meet the replica placement requirement
$ echo "lock; volume.fix.replication -n ; unlock" | weed shell
replicating volume 241 001 from localhost:8080 to dataNode 127.0.0.1:7823 ...

# found one, let's really do it
$ echo "lock; volume.fix.replication ; unlock" | weed shell
replicating volume 241 001 from localhost:8080 to dataNode 127.0.0.1:7823 ...

# all volumes are replicated now
$ echo "lock; volume.fix.replication -n ; unlock" | weed shell
no under replicated volumes
