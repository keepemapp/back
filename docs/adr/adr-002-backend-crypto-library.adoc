= Use pyCryptodome package as main crypto package in the backend


== Prologue (Summary)
Before saving the files from our customers to the storage we need to encrypt them with state of the art cryptography. Those files can be *very big*, and thus we need to careduly look for solutions not loading the entire file in memory. We also need to

According to tink documentation:

> If you need to encrypt live data streams or large files that donâ€™t fit in memory, use the Streaming Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) primitive. Similar to AEAD, this primitive uses a single key for both encryption and decryption.

== Discussion (Context)

|===
|Package|Pros|Cons

|Cryptography
a|* Most used
a|* Complex and __"full of land mines, dragons, and dinosaurs with laser gun"__
* Low level package
* Requires complete message in memory

|tink
a|* FAST AF
* Used and developed at google
* Good documentation
* Great examples on encrypting large files
* Integrated with cloud Key Management Systems
a|* Does not support windows
* Seems to require writing output file to disk only

|pyAesCrypt
a|* Easy to use
* Stream cypher available
a|* Resulting file format (AES v2) has shortcomings
* Not recommended anymore
* An attacker with write access to the encrypted file may alter the corresponding plaintext file size by up to 15 bytes

|pyCryptodome
a|* Mid easy to use
* AEAD ChaCha20-Poly1305 available
* Examples on how to process large files
a|* Not stream cypher
* Manually create the resulting file bytes

Speed comparison. Encryption and decryption time are similar so we just put one.
Tests performed using AMD ryzen 5950K slightly overclocked.

=== Decision
We will use pyCryptodome with cypher ChaCha20-Poly1305

== Consequences


[none]
.Positive
* + Our data storage partners will not have access to our user data since it will
be stored encrypted
* + No vulnerabilities found in CVE libraries
* + Has a lot of different cryptographic features like hashes, Shamir's Secret Sharing...

[none]
.Neutral
* ~ We will implement a way to know which algorithm was the file encrypted with,
so we can implement new ones without modifying previous files
* ~ We will revisit this decision once we have bigger and bigger files which take
longer to encrypt

[none]
.Negative
* - The slowest for large files
