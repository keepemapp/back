= Use Contabo Object Storage as the main distributed file system
:author: Marti Segarra Casas <marti@keepem.app>


== Prologue (Summary)

Part of the services we are offering consist of storing files in a secure and potentially massive scale. We will write the files once and as of now, they will not have to change, so the access pattern will be write once and read 0-10 times a month.

== Discussion (Context)

There are several options available in the market for object/blob storage,
and given the huge popularity of the s3 standard,
we should strive for it.
It’s important those files are stored encrypted.

Designed for posix storage
Fast network required
|Don't require maintenance

== Decision

Our current access pattern uses keys to store and retrieve the files,
so any object storage would suffice, and we do not need POSIX storage.
Since we are the only ones reading and writing to the storage
(auth happens in the API as of now), we only require simple authorization to put and read objects.

Furthermore, it would be ideal to use an s3 compatible API,
which means *Cepth and GlusterFS are not an option*.

This leaves us with S3, Contabo and seaweedFS and we can focus mainly on cost.
While AWS s3 may be cheaper than other solutions, its cost for each TB moved out
of AWS brings a big extra to the bill.
And comparing seaweedFS, where we would need to rent and operate servers, and
contabo object storage, it is not work it for our scale to operate and maintain
servers if there is a good enough price/storage product.

So we will use Contabo Object Storage.


NOTE: While we were inclined to use SeaweedFS, we changed the decision
due to a lower cost of operation and maintenance, since we do not require
now any extra hardware to operate it.

== Consequences (Results)

[none]
.Positive
* + No operating cost apart from the storage
* + One of the cheapest on the market

[none]
.Neutral
* ~ Based on Ceph
* ~ Soft limit of 25TB
* ~ Only available in EU as of now

[none]
.Negative
* - We have to implement file encryption at app level
* - Contabo it's not as big as AWS, although they have been around dor at least 10 years
* - Stability and response time of it is unknown


NOTE: This decision can be revisited when seaweedfs does not fit our operative requirements and due to market innovations
